        <p>
          I began my journey as a full stack developer in May of 2020 and
          quickly developed a passion for software. My journey has mainly
          consisted of self guidance and learning along with mentoring from a
          highly skilled software developer. I love and am very passionate about
          coding. As a self taught and directed developer, I have become
          dedicated to learning and being the best developer I can be. In an
          industry that is ever evolving I understand that I must be as well. I
          try to dive deep into different technical podcasts and technical books
          to help me with that. <br />
